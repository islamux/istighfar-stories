# Contributing to Istigfar-Stories

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## How to Report Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## How to Suggest Features or Enhancements

- Open a new issue on GitHub. Provide a clear description of the feature, why it would be beneficial, and any potential implementation ideas.

## Code Style

- Please try to follow the existing code style.
- Run any available linters before committing your changes to ensure consistency.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!
